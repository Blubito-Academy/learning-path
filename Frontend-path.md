# üó∫Ô∏è Blubito's Learning Path for Front-end developers 

## What is this?
This page is a **guide** for starting to learn to be a front-end developer. The topics are defined in such an order that makes the most sense going in a straight path from one topic to the next one. If you already know about a specific topic - skip it directly and go to the next one. The resources that we have provided are mainly reference points, you're free to use whatever resource/lesson/tutorial/etc. you like.
