## Description
You need to create a small dynamic app like in the provided design from figma.  You need to be able to load a random meme image from an API and via 2 inputs display 2 lines of text in the top and bottom part of the image. You should be able to reload the image and start again.

You can use [Meme API](https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api) or go and research another option you like more.

The design should not be completely the same, but keep in mind it should be pretty and easy to use.
